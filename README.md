# ATS for Recruiters

This project is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for recruiters, built using Django and Django Rest Framework. The application helps recruiters manage and track job applications, with a focus on candidate management. It allows creating, updating, deleting, and searching candidates based on their names.

## Features

- **Candidate Model**: Tracks the following details about candidates:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Email
  - Phone Number


- **API Endpoints**:
  - **Create**: Add a new candidate.
  - **Update**: Update an existing candidate.
  - **Delete**: Remove a candidate.
  - **Search**: Search candidates by name, with results sorted based on relevancy (partial name matches are also considered).

## Search Logic

The search functionality works on the candidate's name. It returns results sorted based on the number of words in the search query that match the candidateâ€™s name. The more matches, the higher the relevancy.

### Example:
For a search query `Ajay Kumar Yadav`, results will be ordered as:
["Ajay Kumar Yadav", "Ajay Kumar", "Ajay Yadav", "Kumar Yadav", "Ramesh Yadav", "Ajay Singh"]


**Important**: The search is done entirely through ORM queries (no Python scripts for filtering or sorting).
